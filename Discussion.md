Discussion: Efficient Log Retrieval
Approaches Considered
1. Brute Force (Inefficient)
Read the entire file line by line and check for the given date.
Issue: Slow and consumes too much memory.
2. Optimized Approach (Chosen)
Use memory-efficient streaming to process the file line by line.
Store results in an output file instead of keeping all data in memory.

Final Solution Summary
Streaming method ensures minimal memory usage.
Efficient filtering using Pythonâ€™s startswith() avoids unnecessary processing.
Direct output writing prevents excessive memory usage.
